<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Quick and easy, mini blueberry scones!  Made in an air-fryer, they are the perfect sweet treat!</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
    <li>4 tablespoons white sugar, divided </li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder </li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon baking soda </li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon salt </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
    <li>1 egg </li>
    <li>¼ cup buttermilk </li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>¼ cup fresh blueberries </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons orange zest </li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Stir together flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
        Cut in butter with two knives or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
    <li>Beat egg with a fork in a small bowl. Remove 2 tablespoons egg to another small bowl; set aside. 
        Add buttermilk and vanilla extract to remaining egg; whisk with the fork until combined.
         Stir into flour mixture until just moistened. Gently stir in blueberries.</li>
    <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Gently knead until dough is no longer sticky, about 8 to 10 strokes. 
        Pat dough into a 6-inch circle. Cut into 8 wedges, without separating, dipping the knife in flour between cuts.</li>
    <li>Combine remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and orange zest in a small bowl. 
        Brush top of dough with reserved egg and sprinkle with sugar mixture. 
        Separate dough wedges and carefully arrange them, using a small wide spatula, in a single layer in the fryer basket,
        in batches if necessary.</li>
    <li>Cook scones until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
