When ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared, It added new features to the language and 
modified some of the existing ones. To keep the old code working, most such 
modifications are off by default. You need to explicitly enable them with 
a special directive: "use strict".  This is placed at the top of a function or
file as so: "use strict";

Variables don't need to be declared first if not using strict

Javascript typically uses camelCase naming

Chromium based browsers use the V8 Javascript Engine
Firefox uses Spidermonkey



Infinity (or -Infinity) is the value JavaScript 
will return if you calculate a number outside the largest possible number.

Division by 0 (zero) also generates Infinity
